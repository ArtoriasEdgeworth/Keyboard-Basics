# Keyboard-Basics
I'm putting together a keyboard, and I'd like to have custom firmware. 

The keyboard is based off of the same PCB as the MagicForce 68, and is mainly MX Green keyswitches, with a few exceptions that give the keyboard character (and make it a pain to program) like an actually locking caps lock, and embedded indicator lights.
